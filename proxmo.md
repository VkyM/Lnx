            Steps:-
               1. If You Are Using Systemd-boot (UEFI + ZFS installs):
                 GRUB changes wonâ€™t apply, because update-grub only works with GRUB.
                 Instead, do this:   Update file like below /etc/kernel/cmdline
                 ```sh root=ZFS=rpool/ROOT/pve-1 boot=zfs quiet amd_iommu=on iommu=pt acpi_osi=Linux modprobe.blacklist=btusb,bluetooth,snd_hda_intel```
                 ```sh proxmox-boot-tool refresh ```
                 Reboot.
